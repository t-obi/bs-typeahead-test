Manages dialog stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n\t * - Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n\t * - It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content, and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n\t * - It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n\t * - Adds the appropriate ARIA roles are automatically.\n\t * - Easily pluggable animations via a `<Transition/>` component.\n\t *\n\t * Note that, in the same way the backdrop element prevents users from clicking or interacting\n\t * with the page content underneath the Modal, Screen readers also need to be signaled to not to\n\t * interact with page content while the Modal is open. To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n\t * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`.
